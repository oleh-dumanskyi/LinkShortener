# LinkShortenerApp
The application I developed as my university diploma project is a web service for creating shortened links (inspired by Bit.ly and similar services). It allows users to create an account and track redirection statistics for their links. Currently, the application is hosted on the Microsoft Azure platform and is accessible at https://shortifier.azurewebsites.net/.
